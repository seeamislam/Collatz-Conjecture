# Collatz-Conjecture

#####Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical phenomenon that has left mathematicians curious for dozens of years. 

The algorithm is as follows: 
- Take any positive integer. 
- If even, divide by 2. 
- If odd, multiple by 3 then add 1. 

#####Repeat the process

Regardless of the initial number, you will always conclude with a sequence of 4, 2, then 1.

For example: When 55 is inputted, it requires 113 procedural repetitions in order to conclude with 1. 

Mathematicians ponder over the explanation as to why this phenomenon occurs.
